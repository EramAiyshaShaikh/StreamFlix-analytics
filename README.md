## Business context

StreamFlix is a subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) platform serving subscribers
across 20 countries, with a catalogue spanning 16 genres across movies and TV series.
Subscribers watch on 6 device types and pay on one of three plans: Basic with Ads
($6.99), Standard ($15.49), or Premium ($22.99).

This project answers the questions StreamFlix leadership needs answered:

- Which genres and titles drive the most watch time, and which underperform?
- Are we losing too many subscribers to churn, and what does an at-risk subscriber
  look like?
- Which subscriber segments (plan, age, region) are most valuable and most engaged?
- Are there seasonal viewing patterns to plan content releases around?
- Which countries/languages are the biggest and fastest-growing markets?
- Is content investment efficient, or are some genres/titles costing more than the
  watch time justifies?

## Dataset

6 CSV files + 1 SQL schema file, ~979,000 records total. Viewing history spans 2017
to June 2026; subscriber signups go back to 2016.

| File | Records | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subscribers.csv` | 15,000 | Subscriber profiles, plan, location, churn status |
| `titles.csv` | 9,000 | Content catalogue — genre, cast, licensing, popularity |
| `watch_history.csv` | 650,000 | Every viewing session — the central fact table |
| `ratings.csv` | 130,000 | Star ratings (1-5) given by subscribers to titles |
| `reviews.csv` | 110,000 | Written reviews with sentiment and helpful votes |
| `watchlist.csv` | 65,000 | Titles subscribers saved, and whether they later watched |
| `schema_and_sql.sql` | — | SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements + 12 analytical queries |

Full column-level definitions are in `data/StreamFlix_Data_Dictionary.docx`. The raw
data files themselves are **not pushed to GitHub** (see `.gitignore`) — only
analysis code and outputs are version-controlled.

## Tools and setup

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) — cleaning, EDA, KPIs
- SQL — 12 reference queries in `schema_and_sql.sql`
- Power BI Desktop (or Excel as an alternative) — final dashboard
- Jupyter / VS Code — notebook development

```bash
conda create -n streamflix python=3.11 -y
conda activate streamflix
conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl numpy jupyter -y
```

Place the 6 dataset CSVs and `schema_and_sql.sql` in `data/`, then open notebooks in
`notebooks/` and run top to bottom.

## Project phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Skills | Est. time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Data Loading, Cleaning & Quality Report | Python/Excel, pandas | 5-6 hrs |
| 2 | Exploratory Data Analysis (10 charts) | pandas, matplotlib/seaborn | 6-8 hrs |
| 3 | Business KPI Calculations & Insights | Python/SQL/Excel | 6-8 hrs |
| 4 | Power BI Dashboard + Management Report | Power BI/Excel/Python | 8-10 hrs |

### Phase 1 — Data cleaning and quality check

Load all 6 tables, profile each (row/column count, dtypes), check missing values and
duplicates, validate data types, flag outliers in `watch_duration_min`, verify
referential integrity, and write a data quality report. Specific checks required:
`churn_date` occurs after `signup_date`; active subscribers have no `churn_date`;
`completion_pct` matches `watch_duration_min ÷ content_duration_min × 100`;
`sentiment` only contains Positive/Neutral/Negative; every `watchlist` entry links to
a real subscriber and title.

**Deliverable:** `Phase1_DataCleaning_Eram.ipynb`

### Phase 2 — Exploratory data analysis

10 required charts, each with 2-3 sentences of written observation: monthly viewing
volume, monthly watch-hours trend (YoY), genre-wise watch-hours share, movies vs. TV
shows split, top 10 countries by watch hours, subscriber plan distribution, device
usage, age distribution, completion rate by genre, review sentiment breakdown.

**Deliverable:** `Phase2_EDA_Eram.ipynb` (charts also saved as PNG)

### Phase 3 — KPI calculations

| KPI | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Total Watch Hours | `SUM(watch_duration_min) / 60` | — |
| Active Rate | Active ÷ Total × 100 | > 70% |
| Churn Rate | Inactive ÷ Total × 100 | < 30% |
| Avg Completion Rate | `AVG(completion_pct)` | > 60% |
| MRR | `SUM(monthly_price)` for active subs | — |
| ARPU | MRR ÷ Active Subscribers | — |
| Avg Watch Time / Subscriber | Total Watch Hours ÷ Active Subs | — |
| Watchlist Conversion | Watched ÷ Watchlist Entries × 100 | > 40% |
| Hit Concentration | Plays from top 10% titles ÷ Total × 100 | — |
| Originals Share of Hours | Hours on Originals ÷ Total Hours × 100 | — |

**Bonus:** Cohort retention — group subscribers by signup month, track what % are
still active at 3/6/12 months (+5 marks).

**Deliverable:** `Phase3_KPIs_Eram.ipynb`

### Phase 4 — Dashboard and management report

**Dashboard** (Power BI or Excel), 5 pages, each with a title, ≥2 charts, ≥1
filter/slicer, and a key-insights text box:

1. Engagement Overview — watch-hours trend, subscriber count, completion/churn cards
2. Content Performance — watch hours by genre, top 10 titles, completion by genre
3. Subscriber Insights — plan breakdown, top 10 countries, new subs per month
4. Experience — device breakdown, rating distribution, sentiment analysis
5. Catalogue & Investment — Originals vs. Licensed, watch hours per $1K spend,
   upcoming license expiries

**Management report** (2-3 pages, Word/PDF, addressed to the CEO, plain language, no
jargon): Executive Summary, Top 3 Findings, Risks Identified, Opportunities, and at
least 3 specific recommendations.

**Deliverables:** `Phase4_Dashboard_Eram.pbix`/`.xlsx` + `Phase4_Report_Eram.docx`/`.pdf`

## Progress

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — Data Cleaning & Quality Report | ✅ Complete |
| 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis | ⏳ Not started |
| 3 — KPI Calculations | ⏳ Not started |
| 4 — Dashboard & Management Report | ⏳ Not started |

**Phase 1 summary:** All 6 tables loaded and profiled against expected row counts.
The only two null columns found — `churn_date` and `license_expiry` — are missing by
design, not error. Zero duplicate primary keys across any table. All required
business-logic and referential-integrity checks (churn date ordering, active/churn
consistency, watch duration validity, completion % accuracy, foreign key integrity
across all child tables, category value consistency) passed with zero violations.
Full detail in `notebooks/Phase1_DataCleaning_Eram.ipynb`.
